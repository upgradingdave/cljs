# Overview

This project is where I experiment building cljs widgets mostly with
reagent and bootstrap css. I usually write a post about lessons
learned building each of these widgets on my blog at
[http://www.upgradingdave.com/blog](http://www.upgradingdave.com/blog).

To run Devcards in hot reloaded dev mode, use `boot dev`, then browse
to `http://localhost:3000/dev.html`

To produces a stand alone, advanced compiled `devcards.js` file (that
can be hosted in production), `boot devcards`, then browse to
`http://localhost:3000/devcards.html`
